# Nostrly

Powers the Cogmentis Nostrly SaaS

NOTE: The plugin code is provided open-source for transparency.

However, it is currently under active development and depends on development branches of robwoodgate/cashu-ts, so is unlikely to build properly without the correct feature branch being manually compiled in node_modules first.

It is therefore NOT recommended for use in production on other websites at this time.

## Installation

Run `./build.sh`

1. Upload `nostrly-saas.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and unzip
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu
3. Go to Settings > Nostrly to configure relay settings
